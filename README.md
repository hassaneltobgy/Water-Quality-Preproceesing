# Water-quality
Objective:
The main objective of this dataset is to assess and predict water potability based on water quality attributes. It can be used for evaluating the safety and suitability of water sources for human consumption, making informed decisions about water treatment, and ensuring compliance with water quality standards.

Machine Learning Task:
This dataset is suitable for a supervised binary classification task, where machine learning models can be trained to predict water potability based on the provided water quality attributes. The models aim to classify water samples as potable (1) or not potable (0).

Data Usage:
This dataset is valuable for water quality assessment, water treatment planning, and ensuring the safety of drinking water supplies. It can be utilized by water treatment plants, environmental agencies, and researchers to make data-driven decisions regarding water quality and potability.
